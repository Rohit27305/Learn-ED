# Learn-ED App - Dockerized

**Learn-ED** is an interactive e-learning platform designed to provide engaging learning experiences with a modern, responsive user interface and robust backend services. This repository demonstrates how to containerize the Learn-ED app using Docker for easy deployment and scalability.

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Docker (Docker Compose for multi-container setup)

## Dockerized Setup

The application is containerized using **Docker** to simplify the deployment process. Docker images for both the frontend and backend are created, and **Docker Compose** is used to handle multi-container orchestration (frontend, backend, and MongoDB).

### Features of Dockerized App:
- **Frontend** and **Backend** applications are isolated in separate Docker containers.
- The **MongoDB** database runs in its own container, ensuring that data is persistent and isolated.
- **Docker Compose** simplifies the setup and orchestration of all services.

## Steps to Run the App:

### Pull the github repo
### Install and Setup docker-compose in your system 
### Run ``` docker compose up --build```
